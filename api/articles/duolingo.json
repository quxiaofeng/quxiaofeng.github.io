I got a lot of experience points. However, the progress was not promising. Now, I change the strategy. Keep going advance everyday and try to finish three icons a day. If I can keep this pace, these three languages should be finished in six months. This pace is really hard to keep. I have little time besides paper and thesis writing. Not to mention that I have to practice and exercise everyday. I can only exercise duolingo in lunch time and in spare time with my smart phone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/duolingo_klingon.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","categories":[{"name":"language","slug":"language","count":8,"path":"api/categories/language.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"software","slug":"software","count":5,"path":"api/tags/software.json"},{"name":"french","slug":"french","count":4,"path":"api/tags/french.json"},{"name":"german","slug":"german","count":2,"path":"api/tags/german.json"},{"name":"android","slug":"android","count":1,"path":"api/tags/android.json"},{"name":"spanish","slug":"spanish","count":1,"path":"api/tags/spanish.json"},{"name":"russian","slug":"russian","count":1,"path":"api/tags/russian.json"}]}
